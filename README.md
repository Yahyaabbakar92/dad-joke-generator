## Things I learned

- Headers in API: (https://apipheny.io/api-headers/#:~:text=API%20headers%20are%20like%20an,track%20down%20any%20potential%20issues.)
  They are additional info that is sent with api data

- CORS: (https://wesbos.com/javascript/13-ajax-and-fetching-data/75-cors-and-recipes/#cors)
  Is a mechanism that allows data to be sent between sites with the data that is being pulled from one site having the "rules" of how to access that data
- fetch API parameters: (https://www.jscamp.app/docs/javascript27/)
  Takes 2 parameters, the URL where you are fetching the data, and an object made up of requests. E.g. method(GET, POST, PUT, etc..), headers, etc..
- Destructuring: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
  Allows us to assign variables to properties of objects or values of arrays

## Thought process

- The user clicks a "Humor me!" button
- Get jokes from API
- Display joke onto webpage
- Tweet joke

## Need to refactor
